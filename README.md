# AssaultOnAtlantisEmbedded

Assault on Atlantis is played on a TI TM4C microcontroller and is played with a potentiometer to move the player and two buttons(one to fire, one to pause). The game is similar to that of the famous arcade game Sea Wolf but with a few changes. 

The player represents Poseidon, the god of the sea. You have been ordered by Zeus to attack the city of Atlantis because they have fallen out of favor with the gods. You are able to throw tridents at passing Atlantean ships but there are sea animals also passing by that should not be hurt. You must gain the highest score by sinking as many ships as possible while also not killing innocent sea creatures.

The game implements a DAC through the headphone jack, an ADC through the potentiometer, and uses SysTick and other timers for game timing.

A video of me playing and describing the game:
